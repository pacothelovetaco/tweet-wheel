:time:
  :late:
    - "Time to get up and start the nightly routine."
    - "Time for the first run of the day. I think I'll take it easy tonight."
    - "Running around, and around, and around..."
    - "...and around, and around, and around..."
    - "I gotta run, I gotta, I GOTTA RUNN!!"
  :afternoon:
    - "Why am I up this early? The sun is still up?"
    - "Is everybody at work? I can't see anyone through the cage."
    - "Do you ever wonder if the world is bigger than what you can see?"
    - "One of these days, I'm breaking out of this place."
    - "Don't tell anyone, but I'm planning an escape."
    - "I has a carrot http://bit.ly/V2azho"
  :morning:
    - "Either I just woke up from a drunken sleep or I'm waking up too early."
    - "I was running in my sleep."
    - "I hate it when the urge to pee wakes you up in the morning."
    - "mmm...I love water."
    - "Hunger pains."

:duration:
  :long:
  # More than 15 mins.

:distance:
  :long:
    - "I just ran DISTANCE miles. Lance Armstrong has nothing on me...well before the drug thing."
    - "DISTANCE miles = a long cardio workout."
    - "Meditating while running: Only (1000000000 - DISTANCE) miles until I reach nirvana!"
    - "If I run long enough, maybe I can get somewhere at some point?"
    - "GQ told me to prepare for the NYC City marathon (to be fair if I was human size I did run DISTANCE x 30)"
    - "Skinnying up... Maybe I can fit through the bars, if I keep at it long enough"
  :medium:
    - "Only DISTANCE tonight. It's just enough to maintain my current weight."
    - "I am on a diet. Eat half, exercise half."
    - "I think I can cheat the system be napping on the exercise machine."
    - "Too hot, too sweaty, need to shave my legs for aergonomics"
    - "And I am off, thats enough to pretend I like my exercise machine"
  :short: 
    - "Ugg. I don't want to run right now."
    - "Not wearing my walking pants today."
    - "Oh nope. My back - bad idea."
    - "Wait did I hear dinner?"
    - "Oops, forgot my prior engagements!"
    - "I shouldn't have eaten that extra carrot"
    - "Uhm, I did a whole day of house cleaning, what do you expect?"

:speed:
  :fast:

    - "Did you see me? I ran so fast that I was a blur!"
  :medium:
    - "Taking it easy tonight. Only SPEED MPH tonight"
    - "My legs are still sore from my last run."
  :slow: 
    - "Potato chips and a couch for me tonight."
